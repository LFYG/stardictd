Just extract the files is OK.

Then compile stardict-client, strip it and copy it to "/var/www/html/www.stardict.org/".

Install "auditd", "policycoreutils-python-utils" and "checkpolicy" packages.
Run:
grep stardict-client /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mypol
semodule -i mypol.pp
Then stardict-client will can connect to tcp_socket!

You need to edit php.ini, set:
magic_quotes_gpc = Off
if you are using php version before 5.4.0!

You may need to edit backend.php file, change:
$cmd="./stardict-client ";
to fit your real "stardict-client" file path!
